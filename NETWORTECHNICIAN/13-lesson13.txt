Basics of Firewalls & Security Rules

--------------------------------------------------

1. What is a Firewall?
----------------------

- A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- Acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
- Can be hardware-based, software-based, or both.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Types of Firewalls
---------------------

- Packet Filtering: Examines packetsâ€™ source/destination IP and ports, blocks or allows.
- Stateful Inspection: Tracks active connections and decides based on connection state.
- Proxy Firewall: Intercepts all messages and forwards them after filtering.
- Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Includes deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Basic Firewall Rules
-----------------------

- Allow or deny traffic based on:
  - IP addresses
  - Port numbers
  - Protocols (TCP, UDP)
- Rules are processed top to bottom.
- First matching rule is applied.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Common Firewall Ports to Allow or Block
------------------------------------------

| Port | Protocol | Common Use          |
|-------|----------|--------------------|
| 80    | TCP      | HTTP               |
| 443   | TCP      | HTTPS              |
| 22    | TCP      | SSH                |
| 25    | TCP      | SMTP (email send)  |
| 53    | UDP/TCP  | DNS                |

--------------------------------------------------

Homework:
---------

1. Identify which firewall (hardware or software) you have at home or work.
2. Find your firewall settings and check rules.
3. Try creating a simple rule to block or allow a port on your PC firewall.
