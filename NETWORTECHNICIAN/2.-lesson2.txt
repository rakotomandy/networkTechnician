===============================

# 1. ping - Test Network Connectivity

# Purpose:
# Sends small packets to another device to check if it responds.

# Syntax:
ping [destination]

# Example:
ping 8.8.8.8
# Sends packets to Google DNS.
# If you get replies, your internet connection is working.

ping www.google.com
# Tests if your DNS resolves domain names properly.
# If this fails but ping 8.8.8.8 works, DNS is the problem.

ping 192.168.1.1
# Tests connection to your router or local gateway.

--------------------------------------------------

# 2. tracert - Trace Route of Packets

# Purpose:
# Shows each "hop" or router that packets go through to reach a destination.

# Syntax:
tracert [destination]

# Example:
tracert www.google.com

# Sample output explanation:
# 1   192.168.1.1        <--- Your router
# 2   10.12.56.1         <--- ISP router
# ...
# 10  142.250.189.206    <--- Destination (Google)

--------------------------------------------------

# 3. nslookup - Check DNS Resolution

# Purpose:
# Resolves domain names to IP addresses using your DNS server.

# Syntax:
nslookup [domain]

# Example:
nslookup openai.com

# Sample output:
# Non-authoritative answer:
# Name:    openai.com
# Address: 104.18.12.213

--------------------------------------------------

# 4. ipconfig /all - Show Network Configuration

# Purpose:
# Displays detailed network info: IP addresses, gateway, DNS, etc.

# Use this to verify your IP settings and identify problems.

--------------------------------------------------

# 5. netstat -ano - Show Network Connections

# Purpose:
# Displays active connections, open ports, and the process ID using them.

# Syntax:
netstat -ano

# Sample columns:
# Proto     Local Address     Foreign Address    State          PID

--------------------------------------------------

# Homework:

# 1. Run these commands:
ping 8.8.8.8
ping www.google.com
tracert www.openai.com
nslookup github.com
netstat -ano

# 2. Write down:
# - Which commands worked?
# - Do you notice DNS issues?
# - Can you identify your router in tracert output?

--------------------------------------------------

# - Wireshark basics
# - Static IP configuration
# - IP subnetting and planning
