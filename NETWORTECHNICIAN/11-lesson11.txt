Routing, NAT & VLANs Basics

--------------------------------------------------

1. Routing Basics
-----------------

- Routers forward packets between different networks.
- They use routing tables to decide where to send traffic.
- The default gateway is the router IP your device uses to send data outside its local network.

--------------------------------------------------

2. NAT (Network Address Translation)
------------------------------------

- NAT translates private IP addresses to a public IP address.
- Enables multiple devices on a local network to share one public IP.
- Types of NAT:
  - Static NAT: One-to-one mapping.
  - Dynamic NAT: Pool of public IPs assigned dynamically.
  - PAT (Port Address Translation): Multiple private IPs share one public IP using different ports (most common in homes).

--------------------------------------------------

3. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
--------------------------------------

- VLANs divide a physical network into multiple logical networks.
- Improves security and reduces broadcast domains.
- Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate without routing.

--------------------------------------------------

Homework:
---------

1. Find your device’s default gateway IP (ipconfig on Windows).
2. Research your home router’s NAT type (check in its admin panel).
3. Read about VLAN tagging and how switches handle VLANs.
