# âœ… BASIC NETWORKING CONCEPTS

1. What is a Network?
----------------------
A network is a group of connected computers and devices that can share data and resources.
Example: Your home Wi-Fi is a network connecting your phone, laptop, and TV.

2. Types of Networks
----------------------
# LAN  - Local Area Network (e.g., in a home or office)
# WAN  - Wide Area Network (e.g., the Internet)
# WLAN - Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi)
# PAN  - Personal Area Network (e.g., Bluetooth)

3. IP Address
--------------
Each device in a network has an IP address, which is like a phone number.
# IPv4 Example: 192.168.1.10
# IPv6 Example: fe80::1c3b:a842:5bfa

4. MAC Address
---------------
MAC = Media Access Control address.
A unique identifier for a network interface (network card).
# Example: FC-3F-DB-0A-A1-6A

5. Subnet Mask
---------------
Defines which portion of the IP address is the network and which is the host.
# Example: 255.255.255.0

6. Default Gateway
-------------------
The IP address of your router â€” used to access the internet or another network.
# Example: 192.168.1.1

7. DNS - Domain Name System
----------------------------
Translates human-friendly names into IP addresses.
# Example:
# www.openai.com â†’ 104.18.12.213

# ðŸ§ª PRACTICAL COMMANDS (Run in Windows CMD)

ipconfig /all
---------------
# Shows full network configuration
# Look for:
# - IPv4 Address
# - Subnet Mask
# - Default Gateway
# - DNS Servers

ping 8.8.8.8
---------------
# Tests your internet connection to Google DNS
# If you get replies, your connection is working

ping www.google.com
--------------------
# Tests DNS resolution (domain name â†’ IP)

tracert www.google.com
-----------------------
# Shows the route your request takes to Google

# ðŸ§  HOMEWORK
---------------
1. Run `ipconfig /all` and write down:
   - IPv4 address
   - Default Gateway
   - DNS servers

2. Try to ping:
   - 8.8.8.8
   - www.google.com
   - Your default gateway

3. Write down:
   - Which worked?
   - Which gave errors?

# Next Step Preview:
# - Understand ping and tracert
# - Use nslookup and netstat
# - Draw your network topology
